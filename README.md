Code controlling experimental flow of several real-time auditory perturbation experiments. Auditory perturbation is achieved by using Audapter https://github.com/shanqing-cai/audapter_mex For stimuli prompting and data acquisition, scripts developed by Phil Hoole at the Institute for Speech Processing, LMU Munich were used https://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/~hoole/

The results of the experiments were partially published in https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.5122788, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095447018302298, https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/1812.html, and https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783030001254
